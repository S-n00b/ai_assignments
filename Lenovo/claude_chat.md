I've created two comprehensive assignment outlines tailored to each role at Lenovo's AAITC:

## **Assignment 1: Advisory Engineer, AI Model Evaluation**
This assignment focuses on:
- **Model Evaluation Framework Design** - Creating comprehensive evaluation pipelines, metrics, and production monitoring strategies
- **Model Factory Architecture** - Building a system to match models to use cases and deployment scenarios
- **Practical Evaluation Exercise** - Hands-on evaluation of foundation models for Lenovo-specific use cases

The assignment emphasizes the role's focus on trying latest foundation models, creating model profiling/characterization tasks, and enabling internal operations/B2B processes to select appropriate models.

## **Assignment 2: Sr. Engineer, AI Architecture** 
This assignment covers:
- **System Architecture Design** - Comprehensive hybrid-AI platform spanning mobile, edge, and cloud
- **Complete Model Lifecycle Management** - Including post-training optimization, CI/CD, and observability
- **Intelligent Agent Systems** - Advanced agentic computing with tool integration
- **Knowledge Management & RAG** - Production-ready retrieval systems
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Board-level presentations and technical documentation

This assignment aligns with your preferred role, emphasizing the full model lifecycle, post-training custom models, guardrail design, and diverse stakeholder communication.

Both assignments:
- Draw from the technical concepts in the provided whitepapers (LLM Development Principles, Context Engineering, Prompt Engineering)
- Align precisely with the job descriptions' requirements
- Include practical, implementable solutions relevant to Lenovo's ecosystem
- Balance theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation
- Assess both technical depth and communication skills

The AI Architecture assignment is more comprehensive and strategic, reflecting the senior nature of the role and your interest in demonstrating capabilities beyond traditional software development experience. It showcases understanding of the entire AI stack while emphasizing ML expertise and model lifecycle management.
