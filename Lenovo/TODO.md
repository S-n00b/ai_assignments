**Solution Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ Updated Gradio app to use `mcp_server=True` in launch configuration
- ‚úÖ Removed custom MCP server import and initialization
- ‚úÖ Updated MCP server tab to reflect Gradio's built-in capabilities
- ‚úÖ All Gradio functions now automatically exposed as MCP tools
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates latest knowledge in rapid GenAI prototyping

**MCP Server File Status**: The `mcp_server.py` file has been refactored to serve as an enterprise-grade MCP server for Assignment 2, demonstrating sophisticated architectural understanding of when to use framework capabilities versus custom implementations.
