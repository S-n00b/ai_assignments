## Key Learning Objectives

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Design**: Create evaluation frameworks for state-of-the-art foundation models
- **Model Profiling**: Develop detailed profiling systems for foundation models
- **Model Factory Architecture**: Design automated model selection systems
- **Practical Implementation**: Hands-on evaluation using latest models (GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.3)
- **Enhanced Experimental Scale**: Integration with open-source prompt registries

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical depth and accuracy (40%)**
- **Practical applicability to Lenovo's ecosystem (25%)**
- **Code quality and documentation (20%)**
- **Innovation and creative problem-solving (15%)**

## Time Allocation

**Suggested Time: 6-8 hours**

- Part A: 3-4 hours
- Part B: 2-3 hours
- Part C: 1-2 hours

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of foundation model architectures
- Experience with Python and ML frameworks
- Knowledge of evaluation metrics and methodologies
- Familiarity with prompt engineering and model APIs

## Deliverables

1. **Evaluation Matrix** - Detailed evaluation framework
2. **Implementation Plan** - Python code demonstrating the framework
3. **Production Monitoring Strategy** - System for real-time performance tracking
4. **Model Profiling System** - Comprehensive model characterization
5. **Model Factory Design** - Automated model selection system
6. **Practical Evaluation Results** - Comparative analysis with recommendations

## Next Steps

1. Review the [Evaluation Framework](evaluation-framework.md) requirements
2. Study the [Model Profiling](model-profiling.md) specifications
3. Design the [Model Factory](model-factory.md) architecture
4. Execute the [Practical Exercise](practical-exercise.md)
