    def __init__(self):
        self.executive_view = ExecutiveDashboard()
        self.technical_view = TechnicalDashboard()
        self.compliance_view = ComplianceDashboard()
    
    def generate_custom_view(self, stakeholder_type: str) -> Dict:
        """Generate custom dashboard view"""
        if stakeholder_type == "executive":
            return self.executive_view.get_metrics()
        elif stakeholder_type == "technical":
            return self.technical_view.get_metrics()

        self._notify_technical_team(incident)
        
        # Executive notification for high-severity incidents
        if incident['severity'] == 'high':
            self._notify_executives(incident)
        
        # Regular updates during incident resolution
        self._schedule_incident_updates(incident)
        
        # Post-incident communication
        self._schedule_post_incident_report(incident)
    
    def _generate_incident_summary(self, incident: Dict) -> str:
        """Generate incident summary"""
        return f"""
        # Incident Report - {incident['id']}
        
        ## Incident Summary
        - **Severity**: {incident['severity']}
        - **Impact**: {incident['impact']}
        - **Status**: {incident['status']}
        - **Duration**: {incident['duration']}
        
        ## Root Cause
        {incident['root_cause']}
        
        ## Resolution
        {incident['resolution']}
