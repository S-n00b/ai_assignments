## :material-book: ARCHITECTURE REFACTORING REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

### :material-architecture: Planning Documents (Created January 2025)

- **[:material-file-document: REFACTORING_PLAN.md](docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md)** - High-level architecture and objectives for Ollama-centric model registry
- **[:material-roadmap: IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)** - Detailed 8-week implementation plan with phase-by-phase tasks
- **[:material-cog: TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md](docs/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md)** - Detailed technical requirements and component specifications
- **[:material-summary: ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md)** - Executive summary of architectural changes and benefits

### :material-key: Key Architecture Changes

#### **Vision Statement**

Transform from complex, metadata-heavy architecture to streamlined, Ollama-centric system:

1. **Ollama serves as primary local model registry** with native categories (embedding, vision, tools, thinking)
2. **GitHub Models API provides remote model serving and evaluation tooling** for cloud-based models
3. **LLMOps platform creates experimental models** from both Ollama base models and GitHub Models
4. **MLflow experiments become additional model objects** in the downstream system
5. **Gradio app receives simplified model objects** from unified registry with both local and remote serving capabilities

#### **New Component Structure**

```
src/
├── ollama_integration/          # NEW: Ollama-native integration (local)
├── github_models_integration/   # NEW: GitHub Models API integration (remote)
├── experimental_models/         # ENHANCED: Experimental model creation
├── unified_registry/           # NEW: Unified model management
└── gradio_app/                 # SIMPLIFIED: Clean evaluation interface
```

#### **Model Categories**

- **Ollama (Local)**: embedding, vision, tools, thinking
- **GitHub Models (Remote)**: OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, Microsoft, others

#### **Key Benefits**

- **40% code complexity reduction**
- **Unified interface** for local and remote models
- **Category-based organization** with local/remote indicators
- **Hybrid serving architecture** - Local Ollama + Remote GitHub Models API
- **Simplified user interface** with powerful experimental capabilities
