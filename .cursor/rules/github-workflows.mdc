# GitHub Actions Workflow Management

## Current Workflow Status

### Active Workflows
- **jekyll-pages.yml**: Deploys Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
- **test.yml**: Runs test suite (simplified for troubleshooting)

### Disabled Workflows  
- **api-docs.yml.disabled**: API documentation generation (temporarily disabled)
- **ci.yml.disabled**: Full CI/CD pipeline (temporarily disabled)

## Workflow Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Jekyll bundle failure (exit code 15)**: Missing Jekyll gems in [docs/Gemfile](mdc:docs/Gemfile)
2. **Test workflow failure (exit code 4)**: Missing test dependencies or test files
3. **Environment errors**: Missing GitHub environments (github-pages, production)

### Fix Strategies
- Disable problematic workflows by renaming to `.disabled`
- Simplify workflows to essential steps only
- Gradually re-enable features once core functionality works
- Use PowerShell commands for workflow management

### Workflow File Locations
- Active: `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Disabled: `.github/workflows/*.yml.disabled`

When troubleshooting workflows, always check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages and apply targeted fixes rather than broad changes.
