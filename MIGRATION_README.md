# üöÄ GitHub Pages Migration - Quick Start

## Replace Jekyll with Unified Platform

I've created a comprehensive solution to replace the old Jekyll site with your unified platform. Here's what I've set up for you:

## üìÅ Files Created/Updated:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-unified-platform.yml` - New GitHub Actions workflow
- `scripts/deploy-github-pages.ps1` - PowerShell deployment script
- `GITHUB_PAGES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
- `MIGRATION_README.md` - Quick start guide (this file)
- `.github/workflows/mkdocs-deploy.yml` - Disabled old workflow

## üöÄ Quick Migration (3 Commands):

```powershell
# 1. Clean up old Jekyll files
.\scripts\deploy-github-pages.ps1 -Clean

# 2. Build the unified platform
.\scripts\deploy-github-pages.ps1 -Build

# 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
.\scripts\deploy-github-pages.ps1 -Deploy
```

## üéØ What You'll Get:
- **Main Site**: https://s-n00b.github.io/ai_assignments/ (Unified Platform)
- **Assignment Overview**: https://s-n00b.github.io/ai_assignments/about/
- **Documentation**: https://s-n00b.github.io/ai_assignments/site/
- **No More Jekyll**: Completely removed and replaced

## üîß How It Works:
- **Unified Platform as Main Entry**: Your `unified_platform.html` becomes the main `index.html`
- **MkDocs Integration**: Documentation builds to `site/` directory and is accessible within the platform
- **Assignment Overview**: Static page showing both assignments
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment on every push to main

## üõ†Ô∏è For GitHub Codespaces (Alternative):
I've also included instructions for GitHub Codespaces in the migration guide. This would allow you to:
- Run the full interactive platform in the cloud
- Share live demos with stakeholders
- Access all services without local setup

## üìã Next Steps:
1. Run the migration commands above
2. Check GitHub Actions for deployment status
3. Visit your site at https://s-n00b.github.io/ai_assignments/
4. Test all functionality to ensure everything works

## üõ†Ô∏è If You Need Help:
- Check `MIGRATION_README.md` for troubleshooting
- Review `GITHUB_PAGES_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- Use the PowerShell script with `-Help` flag for usage information

The solution completely removes the old Jekyll site and replaces it with your unified platform, making it accessible via GitHub Pages while maintaining all your MkDocs documentation. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy updates whenever you push changes to the main branch.
