#### **Email Body Template:**

```
Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Following our discussion about the AI engineering opportunities at Lenovo, I wanted to share a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating my approach to the assignment requirements.

Rather than simply completing the requested AI Model Evaluation assignments, I recognized that the Sr. Engineer, AI Architecture role better aligns with my career goals and expertise. I went above and beyond to create assignments for both roles and developed this entire project as a live, working solution.

The attached presentation showcases a hierarchical workflow:
â€¢ AI Architect Model Customization (fine-tuning, QLoRA adapters, custom embeddings)
â€¢ Model Evaluation Engineer Testing (raw foundation + custom models)
â€¢ Factory Roster Management for Lenovo production deployment
â€¢ Enterprise platform with unified UX/UI and embedded services

This demonstrates not just theoretical knowledge, but practical implementation skills that exceed typical assignment requirements and showcase the meta-assignment innovation approach.

I'm excited to discuss how this hierarchical workflow demonstrates capabilities for the Sr. AI Engineer, Architecture role at Lenovo.

Best regards,
Sam Neubauer
